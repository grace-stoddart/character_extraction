# Character Extraction in Narrative Texts
Code for my MSc Project, extracting characters from narrative texts. Raw datasets are not included in this upload. Processed datasets, intermediate data files and experimental results are obtained by running Jupyter Notebooks, contained within *data*, *notebooks - feature construction* and *notebooks - evaluation*. At the top of each Notebook is a brief introduction explaining the Notebooks purpose and outcomes. The location of Notenooks and the content of each folder in the project is described below. 

### *data*
- Raw data from LitBank, ProppLearner and CEN (not included in this upload)
- Notebooks which pre-process raw data files so they're ready for my character identification pipeline
- Pre-processed data files (not included in this upload)

### *intermediate*
- Intermediate data files, for example semantic parses for each story (not included in this upload)

### *results*
- Experimental results (not included in this upload).

### *notebooks*
- Notebooks for each stage in the character identificaion pipeline: coreference resolution, feature construction and classification.

### *src*
- Modules and functions
